This is the formalisation of the master's thesis 
``Explicit convertibility proofs in Pure Type Systems'' 
written by Floris van Doorn and of the paper with the same name
written by Floris van Doorn, Herman Geuvers and Freek Wiedijk.

The formalisation is made with the Coq Proof Assistant, 
version 8.4pl1, using CoqIDE.
